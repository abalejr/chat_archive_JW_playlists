    <meta name="description" value="JWPlayer offers playlist functionality and a plugin for outplayer capabilities. However, this isn't an option when generating videos using Advanced Custom Fields and Custom Content Shortcode because you can't put a repeater field inside a script tag. This workaround will allow multiple players to mimic the appearance and functionality of a JWPlayer playlist with an outplayer." />
